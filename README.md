## About the project

  AccuChain is an Ethereum based application that helps educational institutes provide transcripts to their students and other entities through Blockchain in a more secure, reliable and tamper-proof manner.
  This app uses Solidity for writing the smart contracts and waffle for testing. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap are used for the UI. 'Main.sol' is the entry point and it inherits the other contracts.
  The front-end and back-end are not connected. Currently, the UI is for demo purposes only. 
  

## Setup Instructions
- Download or clone the repository.
- To install dependencies, go to the terminal and run following commands:
  `cd solidity`
  `npm install`
- For testing, run `npm test`.
 The tests that require checking of a timestamp might fail sometimes due to a tiny time difference between consecutive operations. Please re-run the test if that happens.
- To view the UI, go to /front-end folder and open 'index.html' in chrome browser.
